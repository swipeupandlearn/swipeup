Most singular verbs end in 's'. Examples: He always **drinks** milk, She **eats** bananas, Mom **walks** to work.\n* The third person singular form of some verbs is made by adding **'es'** at the end, especially verbs that end in sh, ch, ss, x, zz and o (e.g., brushes, watches, kisses, fixes, rushes, reaches, misses, mixes).\n* Some verbs that end in 'y' have a vowel before the 'y'; just add an **'s'** at the end to make the third person singular form (e.g., buy - buys, pay - pays, say - says, annoy - annoys, pray - prays).\n* The verb must agree with the **true subject**, not with an intervening plural object of a preposition or any other intervening plural. Example: The box of Nestle’s chocolates **is** missing (subject is 'box').\n* Subjects joined by **'and'** are usually **plural** and take **plural verbs** (e.g., His typewriter and my radio **were** stolen, Sony and Sanjay **are** going).\n\t* **Exception (a)**: If a subject consisting of two singular nouns connected by 'and' refers to the **same person or thing**, a **singular verb** is used (e.g., My best friend and advisor **has** changed his mind, Cornflakes and milk **is** our Sunday breakfast).\n\t* **Exception (b)**: When two subjects connected by 'and' are preceded by **each, every or many a**, a **singular verb** is used (e.g., Each man and boy **is** expected, Every shin, tie and coal **is** marked).\n* Words like **with, together with, along with, besides, as well as, including, in addition to** etc. do **not affect the number of the verb**; if the subject is singular, a singular verb is required; if plural, a plural verb. Examples: The television, along with the cabinet, **is** to be sold. Mrs Paul, with her son and daughter, **is** going.\n* If the subject is made up of both singular and plural words connected by **or, nor, either...or; neither...nor; not only...but also**, the verb agrees with the **nearer part of the subject**. Examples: Neither the quality nor the prices **have** changed. Neither the prices nor the quality **has** changed.\n* If the subject consists of **two singular words connected by or; neither...nor or either...or**, the subject is **singular** and requires a **singular verb**. Examples: Neither our Accounts Department nor our Head Office **has** a record. Sunita or Neeru **has** the swimming suit.\n* Nouns that are plural in form but **singular in meaning**, such as **news, measles, mumps, physics, electronics, tactics, economics** usually take **singular verbs**. Example: News **is** travelling faster than ever before. Some nouns ending in -ics are singular when referring to an organized body of knowledge and plural when referring to individual facts/qualities/activities.\n* A **linking verb** usually agrees with its **subject**, not with its complement. Example: Excessive absences **were** the reason for his failure.\n* **Plural verbs** are required for many nouns that have **no singular form** (e.g., proceeds, goods, ashes, remains, credentials, premises). Example: The proceeds of the magic show **are** to be given.\n* **Collective Nouns**:\n\t* When the group acts as a **unit**, the verb should be **singular** (e.g., The committee **has** agreed).\n\t* When the members of the group are thought of as acting **separately**, the verb should be **plural** (e.g., The teams **are** arguing).\n\t* Company names may be either singular or plural; plural emphasizes individual personnel (e.g., Mudru and Corporation **have** retained the goodwill).\n* When nouns expressing **periods of time, amounts of money, or quantities** are considered as a **single unit**, **singular verbs** are used (e.g., Ten rupees **seems** too much for the job, Three months **is** too long a time to wait).\n* After expressions like **one-half of, two-thirds of, a part of, a majority of**:\n\t* Use a **singular verb** if a **singular noun** follows 'of' (e.g., A part of the office **is** closed).\n\t* Use a **plural verb** when a **plural noun** follows 'of' (e.g., Part of the walls **are** to be painted).\n* The expression **the number** has a **singular meaning** and requires a **singular verb**. The expression **a number** has a **plural meaning** and takes a **plural verb**. Examples: **The number** of board members **is** very small. **A number** of board members **were** absent.\n* In sentences containing **one of**:\n\t* In simple form 'one of' or 'one of the', a **singular verb** is used (e.g., One of the reasons... **is** Ins carelessness).\n\t* In phrases 'one of those who' or 'one of the things that', a **plural verb** is required (e.g., He is one of those managers who **favour** increasing the staff).\n\t* However, when **only** precedes 'one of/one of those', a **singular verb** is used (e.g., Ramesh is the only one of our employees who **is** always alert).\n* Certain collective nouns, though singular in form, are always used in the **plural sense** and take a **plural verb** (e.g., gentry, cattle, poultry, alphabet, offspring). Example: These poultry **are** ready for sale.\n* Certain nouns are always used in **singular** and followed by **singular verbs** (e.g., hair, issue, advice, information, scenery, luggage, mischief, bread, abuse, furniture, land, business, machinery, poetry). Example: Her hair **has** turned grey now. A plural sense can be expressed by using other words (e.g., many **pieces of advice**).\n* The words **each, every, either and neither**, used as pronouns or as adjectives, are always **singular** and require **singular verbs**. Example: Each of them **does** have political ambitions. Exception: If a parenthetical 'each' follows a plural noun or pronoun, the verb should be plural (e.g., The members **each feel** their responsibility).\n* **All, any, more, most, some** may be singular or plural depending on the meaning, and take verbs accordingly. Example: Some of the books **seem** too old. Some of the food **IS** not good.\n* The titles of books or magazines are considered **singular** and take **singular verbs**. Example: The Hindustan Times still **has** wide circulation.\n* Words like **body** (anybody, everybody, nobody, somebody), **thing** (anything, everything, nothing, something), **one** (anyone, everyone, someone, no one) and their compounds are always **singular** and require a **singular verb**. Example: Something **is** wrong with him these days.\n* A **relative pronoun** (who, which, that) used as a subject takes a singular or plural verb to accord with its **antecedent**. Example: Measles is among the diseases that **are** curable."

Writing the body of an Essay**: The body argues, explains or describes your topic. Each main idea from your outline becomes a separate section/paragraph. Begin each body paragraph with a main idea as the introductory sentence, then write supporting ideas with space for detailed examples.\n\t* **6. Writing the conclusion**: Consists of three to five strong sentences. Review your main points and provide reinforcement of your thesis.\n\t* **7. Adding final touch**: Before considering it finished, pay attention to small details and give a nice finishing touch.\n\t\t* Check the order of your paragraphs: strongest points first and last in the body.\n\t\t* Review instructions for desired format.\n\t\t* Reread to ensure it makes sense, sentence flow is smooth, and thoughts are connected.\n\t\t* Check for grammar and spelling mistakes."

        "content": "The general format for almost any letter written in English follows a specific layout and components. This model sets out:\n* (1) the **writer’s address**.\n* (2) the **salutation to the addressee**.\n* (3) the **body of message**.\n* (4) the **closing word or phrase**.\n* (5) the **writer’s signature**.\nReaders in India usually expect these parts arranged in this way.\n* **1. Writer’s Address**: Usually in the upper right-hand corner of the page. Business correspondents may place their address in the letterhead or lower left-hand corner.\n\t* **Envelope Address**: Indian post office requires the addressee’s name on the first line, street address on the second, city/state/pin code on the third, and state/country on the last, all in the center of the envelope. The writer’s name and address should appear in the upper left-hand corner.\n* **2. Salutation**: Placed on the left margin.\n\t* For **informal social letters** (knowing addressee well), use **Dear + first name** (e.g., Dear Rehan).\n\t* For **formal social letters and business letters**, use **Dear + title and family name** (e.g., Dear Mr. Sharma).\n\t* In business letters, other forms like **Dear Publisher** are used to avoid outdated 'Dear Sir'. **Ms.** indicates female gender without marital status and is commonly used in business correspondence unless a position/office is intended.\n* **3. Body of the Letter**: May begin on the left margin or be indented five spaces. An extra space should be left between paragraphs if not indented. The body contains the main message. For formal or business letters, a native English reader expects the writer to **introduce him/herself, state the purpose, and conclude** (often with a 'thank you').\n* **4. Closing Signature**: Usually spaced from the right margin and aligned under the address and date. If the signature may be unreadable, print or type your name underneath. Ensure your name and address are clearly spelled for the reader to use.\n* **Impact on the Reader**: A good letter must be clearly thought out, organized, understandable, well-balanced visually, and silently reflects the writer’s personality as a personal act of communication."
